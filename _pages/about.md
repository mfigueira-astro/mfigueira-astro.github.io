<!-- I am interested in studying low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs). Their formation and evolution are still debated questions in the extragalactic community. I use observational data (UV, optical) of LSBs, in combination with galaxy evolution models to constrain their properties (e.g., star formation, environmental interactions). During my postdoc at NCBJ, I am working with the ASTROdust group (led by Katarzyna MaÅ‚ek) to characterize the dust attenuation in a large sample of galaxies observed by Herschel. I am also an active member of the LSST Galaxies Science Collaboration, with a special focus on low surface brightness science. -->

My research primarily focuses on the study of Low Surface Brightness galaxies (LSBs), particularly the giant LSBs and the ultra-diffuse galaxies. I use observations from UV and optical photometry (e.g., GALEX, CFHT, HSC), as well as spectroscopy (e.g., VLT/MUSE, Magellan/IMACS) to investigate the properties of LSBs. My interests lie in understanding the formation of these galaxies (which is still debated!), the role of the environment in their evolution, and the mechanisms of star formation in low-density regimes. I am also interested in exploring the metallicity, dust, and gas properties of LSBs using multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting methods. Additionally, I use machine learning techniques to identify LSBs from large sky surveys. This is particularly important in the context of the vast discovery space awaiting LSBs in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). I am also an active member of the LSST Galaxies Science Collaboration.
