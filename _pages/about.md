I am an astrophysicist currently working at the National Centre for Nuclear Research in Warsaw. I am mainly interested in the formation of stars in the Milky Way, in particular those forming around Galactic ionized bubbles, and in the formation and evolution of galaxies. As an observer, I am using data from ground based and space telescopes from the near-infrared to the radio range of wavelength (Spitzer, Herschel, ALMA) to better understand the star-formation mechanisms and the processes involved in the evolution of galaxies.
I received a NCN SONATA grant (“The impact of massive stars: from the Milky Way to nearby galaxies”) and a NAWA Bekker grant to work at the Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy in Bonn, on the Outer Galaxy High Resolution Survey.
