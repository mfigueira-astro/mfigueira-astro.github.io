<!-- I am interested in studying low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs). Their formation and evolution are still debated questions in the extragalactic community. I use observational data (UV, optical) of LSBs, in combination with galaxy evolution models to constrain their properties (e.g., star formation, environmental interactions). During my postdoc at NCBJ, I am working with the ASTROdust group (led by Katarzyna MaÅ‚ek) to characterize the dust attenuation in a large sample of galaxies observed by Herschel. I am also an active member of the LSST Galaxies Science Collaboration, with a special focus on low surface brightness science. -->

My main field of interest is the formation of stars in galaxies. On one side, I am studying the impact of Galactic ionised (HII) regions on the observed young stellar objects at their edges. As 30% of high-mass star formation is found to be located around HII regions, my goal is to understand if triggered star-formation is likely to occur and if it leads preferentially to the formation of high-mass stars. On the other side, I am working with galaxies at low-redshift (z<1) with the aim of obtaining their star-formation rates and understanding their star-forming properties.
