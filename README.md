Files to edit in the github page:

For the about page: *_pages/about.md* <br>
For the publications: *_bibliography/papers.bib* and *_pages/publications.md*. In the bib file, change all the '\aap' to 'Astronomy & Astrophysics', and 'adsurl' to 'html'. Also change the 'Junais' to '<b>Junais</b>' to make it bold.<br>
For CV: *_data/cv.yml* and *_pages/cv.md* (the deafult code for this is the json file, but I disabled it - assets/json/resume.json) <br>
For CV pdf: *assets/pdf/CV_junais.pdf* <br>
For profile picture: *assets/img/prof_pic.jpg* <br><br>

Some other general editing: *_config.yml*
